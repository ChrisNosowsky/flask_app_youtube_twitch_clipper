# ProxClips

A simple web app using Python and the Flask framework. Point is to allow one to enter in a Youtube/Twitch Clip URL, provide a timestamp and clip at a point in time. Goes 30 seconds before the timestamp as the lower bound and clips one minute after the timestamp for a total of a minute and 30 seconds.


Future releases will include twitch clip option, multiple clips and minor ui enhancements
